1. **Project Description**

The proposed project is about football events that handle and manage using websites. This website will be one stop center for the event. This is included in the register for the events to announce the winner of the events. We proposed this website to ease the management in handling the event. We presume that the football that we are using in our website is a football event within students IIUM. 

This event we organize during the Conditional Control Movement Order (CMCO) in Malaysia. The purpose of this event is to give the students in IIUM get released their tension of studying and strengthen friendship between each other. This event will be handled with full Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) that was designed by the Malaysia government. Thus, we make our special football rules for this event such as we limit the players for each team for 11 players to 7 players.
